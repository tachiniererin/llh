# llh

A project with a name which meaning has been forgotten to archive knowledge.

## Usage

```sh
# build the part database
cargo run --bin ti -- -b
# download all the datasheets
cargo run --bin ti -- -d
```

Recommended to crawl from an endpoint with a disposable IP, as some sites don't like the traffic.
